# Code for Boosted Sparse Ensembles for Calibrated Uncertainty

- [link to draft of preprint](https://www.dropbox.com/s/yqs9b7de0nudw7v/paper.pdf?dl=0)
- Current code base tests only 1-dimensional synthetic functions; experiments will be updated 
- To run a test with a syntehtic function: cd into tests directory and run "python ***.py", where ***.py is any file in the tests directory.
